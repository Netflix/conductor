## Microservices operations

* https://github.com/flaviostutz/schellar - Schellar is a scheduler tool for instantiating Conductor workflows from time to time, mostly like a cron job, but with transport of input/output variables between calls.

* https://github.com/flaviostutz/backtor - Backtor is a backup scheduler tool that uses Conductor workers to handle backup operations and decide when to expire backups (ex.: keep backup 3 days, 2 weeks, 2 months, 1 semester)

* https://github.com/cquon/conductor-tools - Conductor CLI for launching workflows, polling tasks, listing running tasks etc


## Conductor deployment

* https://github.com/flaviostutz/conductor-server - Docker container for running Conductor with  Prometheus metrics plugin installed and some tweaks to ease provisioning of workflows from json files embedded to the container

* https://github.com/flaviostutz/conductor-ui - Docker container for running Conductor UI so that you can easily scale UI independently

* https://github.com/flaviostutz/elasticblast - "Elasticsearch to Bleve" bridge tailored for running Conductor on top of Bleve indexer. The footprint of Elasticsearch may cost too much for small deployments on Cloud environment.
