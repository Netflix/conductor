## Getting Started - Building & Running Conductor
### Docker
The easiest way to get started is with Docker containers. Please follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/Netflix/conductor/tree/main/docker). The server and UI can also be built from source separately.

### Conductor Server From Source
Conductor Server is a [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) project and follows all applicable conventions. First, ensure that Java JDK 11+ is installed.

#### Development
The server can be started locally by running `./gradlew bootRun` from the project root. This will start up Conductor with an in-memory persistence and queue implementation. It is not recommended for production use but can come in handy for quickly evaluating what Conductor's all about. For actual production use-cases, please use one of the supported persistence and queue implementations.

You can verify the development server is up by navigating to `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html` in a browser.

#### Production Build
Running `./gradlew build` from the project root builds the project into the `/build` directory. Note that Docker is a requirement for tests to run, and thus a requirement to build even if you are building
outside of a Docker container. If you do not have Docker installed you can run `./gradlew build -x test` to skip tests.


#### Pre-built JAR
A [pre-built](https://artifacts.netflix.net/netflixoss/com/netflix/conductor/conductor-server/) executable jar is available that can be downloaded and run using:
 
`java -jar conductor-server-*-boot.jar`

### Conductor UI from Source

The UI is a standard `create-react-app` React Single Page Application (SPA). To get started, with Node 14 and `yarn` installed, first run `yarn install` from within the `/ui` directory to retrieve package dependencies.

There is no need to "build" the project unless you require compiled assets to host on a production web server. If the latter is true, the project can be built with the command `yarn build`.

To run the UI on the bundled development server, run `yarn run start`. Navigate your browser to `http://localhost:5000`. The server must already be running on port 8080.

## Database Requirements

* The default persistence used is [Dynomite](https://github.com/Netflix/dynomite)
* For queues, we are relying on [dyno-queues](https://github.com/Netflix/dyno-queues)
* The indexing backend is [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/) (6.x)

## Other Requirements
* JDK 11+
* UI requires Node 14 to build. Earlier Node versions may work but is untested.
