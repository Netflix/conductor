## Database Requirements

* The default persistence used is [Dynomite](https://github.com/Netflix/dynomite)
* For queues, we are relying on [dyno-queues](https://github.com/Netflix/dyno-queues)
* The indexing backend is [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/) (6.x)

## Other Requirements
* JDK 11+
* UI requires Node 14 to build. Earlier Node versions may work but is untested.
