## Building
To build the server, use the following dependencies in your classpath:

* conductor-common
* conductor-core
* conductor-redis-persistence (_unless using your own persistence module_)
* conductor-es6-persistence (_unless using your own index module_)
* conductor-contribs (_optional_)

## Database Requirements

* The default persistence used is [Dynomite](https://github.com/Netflix/dynomite)
* For queues, we are relying on [dyno-queues](https://github.com/Netflix/dyno-queues)
* The indexing backend is [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/) (6.x)

## Other Requirements
* JDK 1.8+

## Get Support
Conductor is maintained by Media Workflow Infrastructure team at Netflix.  Use github issue tracking for any support request. 

## Contributions
Whether it is a small doc correction, bug fix or adding new module to support some crazy feature, contributions are highly appreciated. We just ask to follow standard oss guidelines. And to reiterate, please check with us before spending too much time, only to find later that someone else is already working on a similar feature. 

`main` branch is the current working branch, while `2.31` branch is the latest stable 2.x branch. Please send your PR's to `main` branch, making sure that it builds on your local system successfully. Also, please make sure all the conflicts are resolved.
