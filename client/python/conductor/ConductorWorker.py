class ConductorWorker:
    """
    Main class for implementing Conductor Workers

    A conductor worker is a separate system that executes the various
    tasks that the conductor server queues up for execution. The worker
    can run on the same instance as the server or on a remote instance.

    The worker generally provides a wrapper around some function that
    performs the actual execution of the task. The function that is
    being executed must return a `dict` with the `status`, `output` and
    `log` keys. If these keys are not present, the worker will raise an
    Exception after completion of the task.

    The start method is used to begin continous polling and execution
    of the tasks that the conductor server makes available. The same
    script can run multiple workers using the wait argument. For more
    details, view the start method

        ----------
        server_url: str
            The url to the server hosting the conductor api.

        thread_count: int
            The number of threads that will be polling for and
            executing tasks in case of using the start method.
        polling_interval: float
            The number of seconds that each worker thread will wait
            between polls to the conductor server.
        worker_id: str, optional
            The worker_id of the worker that is going to execute the
            task. For further details, refer to the documentation

        Parameters
        ----------
        taskType: str
            The name of the task that the worker is looking to execute
        exec_function: function
            The function that the worker will execute. The function
            must return a dict with the `status`, `output` and `logs`
            keys present. If this is not present, an Exception will be
            raised
        wait: bool
            Whether the worker will block execution of further code.
            Since the workers are being run in daemon threads, when the
            program completes execution, all the threads are destroyed.
            Setting wait to True prevents the program from ending.
            If multiple workers are being called from the same program,
            all but the last start call but have wait set to False.
            The last start call must always set wait to True. If a
            single worker is being called, set wait to True.
        domain: str, optional
            The domain of the task under which the worker will run. For
            further details refer to the conductor server documentation
            By default, it is set to None
