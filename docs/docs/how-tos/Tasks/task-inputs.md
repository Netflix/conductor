# Task Inputs

Task inputs can be provided in multiple ways. This is configured in the workflow definition when a task is participating
in the workflow.

### Inputs referred from Workflow inputs

When we start a workflow, we can provide inputs to the workflow in a json format. For example:

```json
{
  "worfklowInputNumberExample": 1,
  "worfklowInputTextExample": "SAMPLE",
  "worfklowInputJsonExample": {
    "nestedKey": "nestedValue"
  }
}
```

These values can be referred as inputs into your task using the following expression:

```json
{
  "taskInput1Key": "${workflow.input.worfklowInputNumberExample}",
  "taskInput2Key": "${workflow.input.worfklowInputJsonExample.nestedKey}"
}
```

In this example, the tasks will receive the following inputs after they are evaluated:
```json
{
  "taskInput1Key": 1,
  "taskInput2Key": "nestedValue"
}
```

### Inputs referred from other Task outputs

Similar to how we can refer to workflow inputs, we can also refer to an output field that was generated by a task that
executed before.

Let's assume a task with the task reference name `previousTaskReference` executed and produced the following output:

```json
{
  "taskOutputKey1": "outputValue",
  "taskOutputKey2": {
    "nestedKey1": "outputValue-1"
  }
}
```

We can refer to these as the new task's input by using the following expression:

```json
{
  "taskInput1Key": "${previousTaskReference.output.taskOutputKey1}",
  "taskInput2Key": "${previousTaskReference.output.taskOutputKey2.nestedKey1}"
}
```

The expression format is based on [Json Path](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/) and you can construct complex
input params based on the syntax.

### Hard coded inputs

Task inputs can also be hard coded in the workflow definitions. This is useful when you have a re-usable task which has
configurable options that can be applied in different workflow contexts.

```json
{
  "taskInput1": "OPTION_A",
  "taskInput2": 100
}
```
